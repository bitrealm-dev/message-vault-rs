# Message Vault

Message Vault keeps your text-message history in one place so you can browse it in a local website—search conversations, open photos and attachments, and see iPhone and Android backups side by side.

You run it on a computer you control. Your messages stay in a database on that machine; they are not uploaded to a cloud service by this project.

Turning a phone backup into files the vault understands is done by a separate project, [message-exporters](https://github.com/bitrealm-dev/message-exporters). This repository is the vault itself: storage, import, and the browser UI.

## How it works

```text
1. Export     Take a backup from your phone or backup app
              → spreadsheet files + photos (message-exporters)

2. Import     Send that folder into your vault
              → vault-push-gui (or a command on the same machine)

3. Browse     Open the website on your computer
              → read and search your history
```

An **export folder** (sometimes called staging) is simply the folder the exporter wrote: one spreadsheet file per conversation, plus any photos or other media next to those files.

## Try it with sample data

No real backup needed. From this repository:

```bash
# Needs Rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and Node.js for the website
./scripts/setup-demo.sh
cd web && npm install && npm run process-assets && npm run dev
```

Open the URL the web app prints (usually `http://localhost:3000`). You should see demo contacts and conversations you can click through.

To put the demo data back later:

```bash
cargo run --release -- reset-demo
```

## Bring in your own messages

### 1. Start the vault and create an account

On the computer that will hold your archive:

1. Copy [`config/config.toml.example`](config/config.toml.example) to `config/config.toml` and adjust paths if you like.
2. Build and start the import server:

```bash
cargo build --workspace --release
cargo run --release -- serve
```

3. In another terminal, start the website:

```bash
cd web && npm install && npm run process-assets && npm run dev
```

4. Open the site, create an account, then go to **Settings** and copy your **Import API token**.  
   That token identifies your account. You do **not** need an account UUID.

Keep `serve` running while you import.

### 2. Export your phone backup

On the machine that has your backup files, use [message-exporters](https://github.com/bitrealm-dev/message-exporters). Pick the converter that matches what you have (for example Apple Messages, SMS Backup & Restore, SMS Backup+, GO SMS Pro).

You will get an **export folder** of CSV spreadsheets and media. Open a CSV in a spreadsheet app if you want to spot-check names and times before importing.

### 3. Send the export into the vault

The easiest way is the graphical importer.

On the machine that has the export folder (it can be a different computer from the vault, as long as it can reach the vault over the network):

```bash
cargo run -p csv-ingest --bin vault-push-gui --features gui --release
```

Then:

1. Enter your vault URL (for example `http://127.0.0.1:8080` or your vault host’s address).
2. Paste your **Import API token** from Settings.
3. Click **Authenticate**.
4. Choose the export folder and the source type (or let detection pick it).
5. Click **Start import**.

Progress appears in the log. You can close and re-run later; unfinished chats can resume with append mode.

**Command-line option** (same idea, no window):

```bash
cargo run -p csv-ingest --bin vault-push --release -- \
  --input ./path/to/your-export-folder \
  --source-id go-sms-pro \
  --url http://vault-host:8080 \
  --token "$VAULT_API_TOKEN" \
  --mode append
```

Omit `--account` when using your personal Import API token. If you use the server’s admin token from `config.toml`, pass `--account yourusername`.

### 4. Browse

Refresh the website. Use the **Source** control in the sidebar to look at one backup type or **All (combined)**. Under contacts you will see **Contacts**, **All**, and **Excluded**—see [`web/README.md`](web/README.md) for details.

## Same computer (optional)

If the export folder already lives on the vault machine next to your config, you can import without the network push tools:

```bash
# One source (username from your web account)
cargo run --release -- ingest go-sms-pro --account yourusername

# Or several sources that already have folders under staging/
./scripts/ingest-staging.sh --account yourusername
```

Then convert media for the web UI if needed: `cd web && npm run process-assets`.

## Browse tips

- **Source filter** — one archive (e.g. iMessage only) or everything together.
- **Contacts** — people with messages who are not marked excluded.
- **All / Excluded** — manage who appears in the main Contacts list via `exclude` in your contacts CSV (see config examples).

More UI detail: [`web/README.md`](web/README.md).

## For developers and operators

This section is for people maintaining the vault, wiring automation, or debugging imports.

### Repository layout

```text
crates/
  message-json/     # vault NDJSON schemas
  csv-ingest/       # CSV → vault convert + vault-push / vault-push-gui
  demo-seed/        # regenerate committed demo data
config/             # config.toml.example and related examples
scripts/            # setup-demo, ingest-staging, smoke tests
web/                # Next.js UI
docs/               # schema, dedupe
```

Backup → CSV converters live in [message-exporters](https://github.com/bitrealm-dev/message-exporters), not in this repo. Fill each source’s `export_dir` (staging) before local `ingest`.

### Config sources

See [`config/config.toml.example`](config/config.toml.example). Each `[[sources]]` entry has an `id` and `export_dir`. Asset files default under `data/<account_id>/<source_id>/…`.

Ingest contract (CSV columns → vault NDJSON): [`crates/message-json/docs/CSV_INGEST.md`](crates/message-json/docs/CSV_INGEST.md).

### HTTP import API

`serve` reads `[server]` in config (`bind`, `api_token`). Prefer **vault-push** (multipart: conversation data + attachment files). Per-account tokens come from web Settings; `[server] api_token` is an admin secret for ops/smoke.

```bash
curl -sS "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/auth/check" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <user-token-from-settings>"
```

Smokes: `./scripts/smoke-import-api.sh`, `./scripts/smoke-vault-push.sh`.

### Import modes and dedupe

- **replace** — wipe that source’s messages, then reload.
- **append** — keep existing rows; skip when `(source, guid)` already exists.

Cross-source soft-dedupe (exact / near-time matches): [docs/dedupe.md](docs/dedupe.md).  
Database tables: [docs/schema.md](docs/schema.md).

```bash
cargo run --release -- import --source imessage --mode replace --account yourusername
cargo run --release -- dedupe-cross-source --account yourusername
```

### Obsidian export

```bash
cargo run --release -- export-markdown --out /path/to/Obsidian-Message-Vault --account yourusername
```

Enable the `message-vault-bubbles` CSS snippet in Obsidian (from `config/obsidian-message-vault.css`).

### Demo data for maintainers

```bash
cargo run -p demo-seed -- --out demo --seed 42
```

See [`demo/README.md`](demo/README.md).
